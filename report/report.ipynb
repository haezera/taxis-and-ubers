    "We began with the goal of creating a fare model for NYC rideshare trips, based on NYC taxi data that spanned 2009 - 2024. This project was end-to-end; and involved actions from data sourcing and cleaning, all the way to model selection and feature creation. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Data sourcing, and initial data issues\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is directly sourced from the New York City (NYC) Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC). The data can be found below at this [link](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page). The data is stored in parquet files, which is convenient and *fast* for pandas IO.\n",
    "\n",
    "There were initial issues with the column names across years, and how some years/months had geolocation data while other's didn't. Below is a demonstration of such issue."
