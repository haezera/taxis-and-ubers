This end-to-end data project considers a hypothetical business case of a company called `Surfer`, starting up a ride share business in NYC. 

This is a project with *lots* of data - we are talking millions and millions of taxi trips. I used this project as a way to teach myself more about how to apply machine learning techniques beyond linear regression, as well as outside of the domain of financial markets which is what I've become accustomed to.
