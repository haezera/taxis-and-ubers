# Some assumptions

## No information available regarding taxi fare rates
There have been some assumptions made to aid the project being more educational and representational to my ability.

For most of the project, we have assumed that the data I have in `./data`, which is pulled directly from the TLC website, is all I have. Of course, I could just search up the taxi rate and use that as the basis of my model - but what fun would that be :(
- The only exemption of this rule I could find, was that I used Googled data of the taxi fare rises to adjust the data.

## Ignoring `rate codes`

Ignoring rate codes provides an extra challenge for this project. In particular, by ignoring rate codes we have to apply more challenging data cleaning methods such as clustering to get rid of outliers and unwanted data. 

This made the data cleaning process much more interesting, and more importantly, educational.
